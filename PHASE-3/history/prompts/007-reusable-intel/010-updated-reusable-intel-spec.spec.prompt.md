# Specification 07: Reusable Intelligence Design

## Objective
Create a system for reusable intelligence with focus on long-term acceleration, skill creation, subagent usage rules, and safety.

## Key Components
- Reusable skills that can be leveraged across multiple AI interactions
- Subagent orchestration with configurable rules
- Safety mechanisms and guardrails
- Long-term learning and adaptation capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Enable efficient skill reuse across contexts
- Implement safe subagent delegation
- Improve system performance over time
- Maintain safety and reliability standards
